Behind a field there's a field, behind a field - a field and a field
Behind the Black Road, behind the Great Meadow
They are already in a mist - like a mist -
Everybody already follow Time, like a plough

What a heavy steps Eternity haves!
Behind the Black Road, behind the Great Meadow
Such free and young -
Is it real that I already follow Time, like a plough?!

What I will plough? What a field I will sow?
Behind the Black Road, behind the Great Meadow
Is it real that I'm in a mist too - like a mist -
And I already follow Time, like a plough?..
